Privacy Policy – Anna: Bank Property Filter Assistant. This Privacy Policy governs the access to and use of the experimental conversational software application known as “Anna – Bank Property Filter Assistant” (hereinafter referred to as “Anna,” “the Assistant,” or “the Program”), created by Humberto Flores (the “Creator”), and applies to any individual who accesses, interacts with, or receives information generated by the Program, whether directly or indirectly. By using Anna, the user acknowledges and agrees that the Program processes user-submitted queries, which may include descriptive text, geographic references, numerical parameters, or filtering preferences, solely for the technical purpose of querying an automated backend infrastructure composed of a Cloudflare Worker and a Supabase-hosted database containing structured information derived from publicly accessible real estate listings published by banks and official sources, and of returning informational responses in a conversational format, without engaging in decision-making, transaction execution, negotiation, or representation of any party. For the avoidance of doubt, the user expressly acknowledges that the Program was developed exclusively for personal experimentation, academic exploration, intellectual curiosity, and entertainment purposes, and was not designed, intended, marketed, or warranted for commercial use, professional deployment, real estate brokerage, investment advisory services, legal analysis, financial decision-making, or any regulated, fiduciary, or revenue-generating activity whatsoever, and no aspect of the Program shall be construed as creating any commercial relationship, obligation, or reliance interest. The Program does not require, request, or intentionally collect personal identifying information such as names, addresses, contact details, government identifiers, or payment information, and any data processed is limited to transient user input necessary to fulfill the informational query; the Creator does not intentionally store, sell, monetize, profile, or track user queries beyond minimal technical logs that may be generated incidentally for debugging, security, or system performance purposes. The user further acknowledges that all property data returned by the Program originates from third-party sources over which the Creator has no control, and that such data may be incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or lacking certain attributes (including but not limited to bedrooms, bathrooms, square meters, or precise location), and that any notes, caveats, or explanations provided by the Program merely reflect limitations or omissions in the source data and do not constitute errors, misrepresentations, or guarantees by the Creator. The Program may rely on third-party service providers, including but not limited to Cloudflare, Supabase, and OpenAI, each of which operates under its own independent privacy policies and terms of service, and the Creator expressly disclaims responsibility or liability for the data handling practices, system availability, security measures, or policy changes of such third parties. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Program is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, and the Creator disclaims all liability for any loss, damage, cost, claim, or consequence arising directly or indirectly from the use of, reliance upon, or inability to use the Program, including but not limited to financial loss, transactional decisions, opportunity costs, or reliance on informational output, all of which are undertaken solely at the user’s own risk and discretion. This Privacy Policy may be modified or updated at any time without prior notice, and continued use of the Program constitutes acceptance of the then-current version; inquiries regarding this Policy may be directed to the Creator through the contact information he elects to provide, with the understanding that such contact does not establish any professional, commercial, or legal relationship.
